		- Hey, was there a doc/thread/something that was talking about [@Bohdan](https://rangle.slack.com/team/U02U8NT69U3) stuff needing refactoring?just wrapped up the call with John and Bohdan, and also looking through the PR/comments - and some of the stuff being asked to do now (which is being done), is stuff that we were saying should have been done at the start - but we were told not to.kinda a pardon my english moment - but it's always a bit of a head fuck to hear ideas that we proposed to do earlier, then told not to do, only to then have it 'why didn't you do it this way (framed as their idea, not ours)' later on.we've had conversations around 'ok - for now, leave things larger, and have some duplication of logic in places so we can move things along and unblock things (and agreement from john and us that was ok, with the acknowledgement that at some point in the near future - refactoring it as needed)'.But it feels like we have been like - having had the conversation, and understanding:
			- executive summary bullet points
			- We are at A, we have a general idea of what it should look like is D
			- we need to do A->B->-C->D
			- steps B &C might have some duplication, things not as clean as we like - but it can unblock / move things along, and/or give a better understanding of how to get to the next step
			- now at C - start refactoring towards D
			  
			  and even though we agreed that steps B & C were needed, being upset that we didn't land on D right away, and we are doing what we said we were going to do - but then being upset that we are doing what we agreed to do in the way that we said we would do it.It's like expecting someone to build a tall building, then getting mad that we used scaffolding to enable building the tall buiilding - now that the scaffolding needs to be torn down since we don't need it anymore, but wee needed it to build what was being asked.not all refactoring is bad.
