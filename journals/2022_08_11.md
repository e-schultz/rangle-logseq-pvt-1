		- Hey, was there a doc/thread/something that was talking about [@Bohdan](https://rangle.slack.com/team/U02U8NT69U3) stuff needing refactoring?just wrapped up the call with John and Bohdan, and also looking through the PR/comments - and some of the stuff being asked to do now (which is being done), is stuff that we were saying should have been done at the start - but we were told not to.kinda a pardon my english moment - but it's always a bit of a head fuck to hear ideas that we proposed to do earlier, then told not to do, only to then have it 'why didn't you do it this way (framed as their idea, not ours)' later on.we've had conversations around 'ok - for now, leave things larger, and have some duplication of logic in places so we can move things along and unblock things (and agreement from john and us that was ok, with the acknowledgement that at some point in the near future - refactoring it as needed)'.But it feels like we have been like - having had the conversation, and understanding:
			-
			- 'well, it's a gruby way of doing this anyway' - with that 'gruby way', being less nice than doing the 'cleaner' way from the get go.I guess we're a little salty about the fact that suggestions that were made several times by several different people about about ways to simplify code and make it more improve the engineering architecture were largely ignored.i don't think we are trying to be salty about it - we are trying to point out that thinkgs moving towards a better state now, but we could have saved time and effort if some of this had been diagnosed sooner.If it is because of the time pressure we have for this project, then i'll have to have a talk with John about that. Someone also mentioned that they were told to 'get it running' and not to optimize, in order to just get it done and not get dicked with code reviews.I'm not sure if i'm understanding this thread correctly but if there's feeling that we are grubby and optimizing the code in a way that is unacceptable then @v1k0d3n and i can do a code review of the PRs to see if they meet our standards.I will also admit - we've been pretty focused on cleaning things up in the PRs in flight - but that also has been focus of ours. We must also admit there's some things where making things better code wise often breaks things for the client (and constant wireframes changes have broken us several times) - but in those cases - we can make a decision where we say 'ah, this is a hurdle we just have to overcome to move forward' - and usually these things are not a large amount of work to look back (which we do - we don't want to write bad code ever - but sometimes we want to move on, and can look at it later' - and try to bring it down.and yeah - we are in the thick of things right now - and what you described is how we do things when we are in that thick of things.it's alot easier for us to do this when we are doing 10k lines / day - then looking back on 50k lines from last month and saying 'we should have done it this way' - because usually its not an easy change really when you write bad code, and then have it fester for a while (like we do in20 PRs deep in code).I think the why's and how's you're describing is the pre- stages of the intermediate and final refactorings. Maybe the final refactor is the exact process you described, where you have the docs, approach, and process to refactor bad code that is locked in production, but we're not quite at that point yet. it sounds like you guys got dicked around with code reviews, simply because we're still in process of building.Thank you @CodeOfAnarchy and @v1k0d3n and @Bohdan. The Github Issue that is being referenced is the one I provided in the original Create case.All I know is there already seemed to be a 'passed' functional test suite ready to hand off, and that they were falling behind in code reviews. I was able to verify that they were initially told that some of their approaches were incorrect, only to have those approaches eventually validated and/or used. If a person is of the opinion that some of their suggestions should have been ignored, that's fine... however, to have them adopt a 'grubby way of doing this anyway' that took more time to rework / refactor in a later time, seems... well... grubby.  
			  Even if a lot of the suggestions wererefactorings, etc, rather than improvements / bug fixes, I'm assuming it's pretty cocky of them to throw people under the bus on their own behalf when there was agreement all around as to where the project was going and how, seemingly. Grubby even.Some of the risk is whether, as project's go, they'll ever do something 'grubby' to act on some of their own advice now, only to have it himself validated in a later time. This reminds me of the saying, 'live by the sword, die by the sword. ' 
			  But like I said, if they think that's how they need to operate and that's fine. If they want to back it up, throw their own people under the bus and their own operations under the bus even if they're implementing the accepted processes and if they're always implementing the 'right' way from the start, that's on them.  
			  It's not as if these things don't happen in the course of a project, it's just that, in my experience, it happens more often than not. If a client comes back and says, 'I know we said to do it this way
		- We are at A, we have a general idea of what it should look like is D
		- we need to do A->B->-C->D
		- steps B &C might have some duplication, things not as clean as we like - but it can unblock / move things along, and/or give a better understanding of how to get to the next step
		- now at C - start refactoring towards D
		  
		  and even though we agreed that steps B & C were needed, being upset that we didn't land on D right away, and we are doing what we said we were going to do - but then being upset that we are doing what we agreed to do in the way that we said we would do it.It's like expecting someone to build a tall building, then getting mad that we used scaffolding to enable building the tall buiilding - now that the scaffolding needs to be torn down since we don't need it anymore, but wee needed it to build what was being asked.not all refactoring is bad.
