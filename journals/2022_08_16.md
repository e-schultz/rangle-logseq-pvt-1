				- TIAA - has 17 design systems

					- then teams started to fragment
					- lots of tech debt from old design systems
					- latest design system - SVC3, Web Components, using Lit
					- TIAA Hope: One design system to rule them all
				- TIAA - Dynamics between Design and Development
					- John Whitman - head of UX - wants to make his vision a reality
					- TIAA Friction: "You know, what's, what's what's happening. So, as an example, just like last week, we started to do the first kind of tech feasibility meetings. And right away there was a big concern because you know, the what design thought could be achievable, and what engineering tell them is achievable is completely different. And so right away, it gets to a friction point" -- Naim
					- Rangle - initially suggested we use Material, and going with Material and Angular --- oooouf
						- Hesitant on going back to the Angular Material choice, enterprise problems of slow choices and decision makements
					- Haven't really started on Dev yet
