		- I'm looking forward to this - I've enjoyed helping him out with it over the last little while, it's been a learning experience for me as well, and he's given me good feedback on finding out chats valuable
		- Going to try and have a post-mortem / retro on it after - but excited to join this in a little bit, it starts at 9:94
	- Yesterday I got a slack from n1ck about the [[Angular IO Learning Journey]] thing

		  13:24 - I want to share with Google core team
			- [evan](https://rangle.slack.com/archives/D02JJNK3L/p1654651745863809) hey,
			  wrote up some notes in notion (you already have access to this page I think)

			  Did a quick re-recap of the react beta docs (I think this will set the standard of what people expect)
			  
			  looked a bit more into Sandpack + some details on codeamigo that is using Sandpack to re-create the existing 'Tour of Heros' with angular

	- Synced up with Willian a bit
		- should chat later today, or tomorrow - although he got Dawn to step in for the Free Agents [msg](https://rangle.slack.com/archives/DJ2J7S4KV/p1654620294007529) which is good,
		  
		  although for some reason I thought there wasn't any bench at the time - so
