	  🧙‍♂️: I have a fairly curated list of resources, some from last year, some from this year relating to pride, kink, consent, etc - excellent at searching my history + fairly organized threads
		- exhibit A: [[feeling like being problematic and starting a the discourse thread ]]
		- exhibit B: https://t.co/w0r1nkQTnK 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈 [[thread of threads  to collect threads of queer stuff,  as I am one who likes to collect things]]. 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
		- exhibit C: https://t.co/EJpFK82PLA
		- exhibit E: https://t.co/ofZ01X0UJV
		- I'll also try and include threads from other people around twitter that have done a deeper dive, or more thorough exploration on things.
		  
		  For longer threads - book mark to key parts.
		- Like this rather long thread https://t.co/R1o1n5Qx12
		- I also know in the day of I only read the headline,
		  
		  I'll actually read the article - or try to, and summarize : screen shot key points
		- and when I treat twitter kinda like public Zettelkasten note taking system,
		  
		  alot of my threads end up densely linked, easier to find / and sometimes get lost in 
		  
		  [[twitter as Zettelkasten]] https://t.co/V4PA7r643y
		- the queer phobes, antis, bad faith questions, alt right trolls /- are expecting you to engage in civil discussion 
		  
		  don't be civil 
		  get queer 
		  get loud 
		  info dump with a fury https://t.co/9nbLjGepX8
		- organize your anger and information vomit at trolls, don't wasted your time typing out personalized civil replies.
		  
		  learn to scale your queer wrath https://t.co/8gvMeGOhkV
