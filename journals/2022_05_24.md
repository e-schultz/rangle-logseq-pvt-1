Catching up on work

	- Ok, so it's been awhile since I've opened my work notes, or notion - or caught up with anything.
	- Since it's been so long since going into obsdmd - figured I'd give logseq a try for a little bit and see how that works into my flow.
	  
	  I do miss outliners,
	  and I do miss being able to have linebreaks within a block.
