- Write advanced tutorial on how to build a SaaS product using JavaScript
	-
	- There are a few things you need to do in order to build a SaaS product using JavaScript. First, you need to choose a JavaScript framework. For this tutorial, we'll be using Node.js. Next, you need to choose a database. In this tutorial, we'll be using MongoDB. Finally, you need to choose a web server. In this tutorial, we'll be using Express.
	  
	  Now that you've chosen your tools, it's time to start building your product. The first thing you need to do is set up your project structure. Create a folder for your project and then create a folder for your server. In your server folder, create a file called server.js. This will be the file that contains your server-side code.
	  
	  Next, you need to install the dependencies for your project. For this tutorial, we'll be using the express and mongodb modules. To install these modules, run the following command in your terminal:
	  
	  npm install express mongodb --save
	  
	  Now that you have your dependencies installed, you can start building your server. In your server.js file, require the express and mongodb modules.
	  
	  var express = require('express'); var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
	  
	  Next, you need to initialize your express application.
	  
	  var app = express();
	  
	  Now, you need to write the code for your server. For this tutorial, we'll keep things simple and just return a JSON response when a user hits the root route.
	  
	  app.get('/', function(req, res) { res.json({ message: 'Hello, world!' }); });
	  
	  Finally, you need to start your server.
	  
	  app.listen(3000, function() { console.log('Server is running on port 3000'); });
	  
	  That's it! You now have a basic SaaS product built using JavaScript. In the next section, we'll learn how to add a database to our product.ngs
