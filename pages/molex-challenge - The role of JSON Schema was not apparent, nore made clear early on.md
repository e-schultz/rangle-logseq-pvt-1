- JSONSchema is a fairly large spec, and was core to how their application worked.
- Alot of the questions that would come up during backlog refinement / sprint planning, was asking questions "well, what does the schema look like for this?", and a common answer would be "it's in the JSON schema" - but not being clear what that was, or where to find it, or how it worked in the application as a whole
