	  Hello there .. Are Free Agent Standup meetings still happening?  I have a staff member who is a free agent and has said he has attended the meetings, but nobody was on.

		  Hey,
		  When I got involved with Molex, some other people were to take over free agents, but then they got absorbed into a project - then the bench vanished for a bit.
		  I've been out of the loop for awhile on it, and know a few people are agents again - but as far as I'm aware, noone is running the show (I'm just getting back upto speed myself)
		  I had asked about this - and apparently most people that are on the free agents right now, might get pulled into a project soon.
		  FA def did do a 'fizzle out thing' again ;(
