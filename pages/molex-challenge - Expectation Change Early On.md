- **initial expectation:**
  id:: 628eb4bb-91c7-4b7d-bbfa-f4acb85c6c55
	- More coaching and enablement for the team, more pair programming, more focus on leveling up their team
	  id:: 2b0922b8-83c2-4361-94aa-413e37a034f1
- **actual expectation:**
  id:: d62766f7-dcb6-48c8-8a24-b918d5884393
	- our team delivers, less focus on leveling up their team
	  id:: 90df15ff-b229-47fa-a6c4-10e0ece3e6e5
- **impact:**
  id:: 8c5aaadf-a28a-4faf-8ddc-59e05558be2c
	- We managed to adapt, although for awhile it felt like it was two separate teams - not one team.
	  id:: cbf6cad9-7695-4820-a715-4dbb895b3cc8
	- Our developers ended up picking up stories to work on on their own
	  id:: de7c65ac-5b02-431b-948e-057461ea191e
		- challenges with this:
		  id:: f1d71c98-2c6a-4609-82ac-5a2b037f22f6
			- they were not a part of sizing them
			  id:: 46e295cf-0d4c-4a47-a2b8-cb603b2f9d55
			- we didn't know the full system yet
			  id:: 4cce7ee4-c10d-437e-9bff-a4a4cb95aaf0
			- so many unknowns
			  id:: 8221c4a6-7de0-4694-8735-429978e5a586
		- what could have been better:
		  id:: 94a5d92d-841f-4221-9e5e-ed4b7ff5ecd6
			- Even with the shift from enablement to delivery, the first week - we should have still picked up stories in pairs with their developers, instead of working on our own.
			  id:: dc7552cb-6319-42d0-86f1-c032023fd426
				- There was a missed opportunity for knowedge transfer and team building
				  id:: 03de486b-5dc9-47f0-8974-e98bf7dad3ef
				- and getting exposed to how the team works, and the codebase with people who work with it regularly.
				  id:: 83328b01-3cc2-45b8-bca6-7907e538666e
	- **molex pattern - "I wasn't there for that conversation"**
	  id:: 1ebb1b42-0919-4cf8-88c8-cf4a187ce3da
		- User stories are meant to be a conversation, but we need the right artifacts from those conversations - or the person who's doing the work, is missing part of the information.
		  id:: 3d149873-2f22-431c-a7a2-177f2f88524b
		- It wasn't uncommon for user stories to have fairly minimal requirements,
		  id:: 8ba5a55b-80cb-45ec-80d1-1e5926607c9d
		  now and then we would hear "well, we talk about them - so we've had conversations about this", but for some of those stories, the people picking up the work - were not there for that conversation.
		  
		  Keeping track of key elements is important, 
		  and/or - when someone asks questions about the user story, don't assume that they just know if it isn't written down.
