- **pattern** - When doing a code review, or walking through a user story / figma, etc and talking about the work that needs to be done.

  There are many areas in the code base that could be improved, and a number of them have been suggested / documented / shared.
    
  The PO though - had a walk of providing feedback where it was hard to always tell if what he was talking about was meant for a "this should be done right now", vs "this is something that could be done later"
	- **impact** - Scope creep
	  It would be easy to think that everything that we had talked about was to be done,
	  or someone would think that A and B but not C, and they were expecting B and C, and A for later.
		- at times this lead to more complex / larger PR's due to adding 'all the features'
		- duplicated work - as at times these conversations would happen with different people on different areas of the code
		- not a shared understanding of whats now vs whats later
			- **action:** Clarify in Writing at the End
				- Clarify - what are we doing now, vs later - get them to agree, and then update the ticket to reflect that
