- **Why didn't you already know this?**
	- **pattern:**  a conversation pattern would start to occur when talking with one of the product owners.
	  id:: 628eb2c1-edd0-45bf-b8f1-eb4f5961db28
	  
	  The questions people would be asking, were reasonable "this helps provide clarity to the thing I am being asked to do", and need to know information for completing the story.
	  
	  However, how they would answer the question / end the conversation, would be in a way of saying :
		- background-color:: #49767b
		  > "you should have known this already, and if you didn't know already - why hadn't you asked sooner?"
	- **impact:** - team didn't feel as safe asking questions
	- **actions:**
		- I get more involved
		- more hands on with the devs
		- join meetings with them and that PO
		- play PO to team translator a bit better
