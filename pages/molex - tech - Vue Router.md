- ## Molex Considering Moving away from router
	- at one point they had mentioned possibly wanting to remove the router since they "don't need it"

			- Developers would mention that when working on the application, if they had to reload the page they had to
				- to navigate back to the first screen of the application
				- select the module
				- select the sub module
				- a few more steps
				- and back at their previous screen
			- this was a point of frustration, lead to needing to repeat a lot of steps.
				- the core issue was how the router was being used, and replicating some of what could have been kept track of through the URL, via updating the vuex state instead.
