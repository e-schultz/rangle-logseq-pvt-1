	- In theory, people against kink at Pride believe we‚Äôre going to lose all our rights ... : Republicans won‚Äôt stop at policing how we dress, they‚Äôre happy to take our rights away no matter what we‚Äôre wearing.

	  I see that you read nothing
	  
	  as expected.
	  
	  If you don't see the relationship between  the right to bodily autonomy, self expression and not policing peoples bodies and "no kink at pride is a shitty fascist take"

	- if you have a narrow cis het definition of kink, and only view it as a sex act.
	  
	  but you starting from an intentionally bad faith position.
	  
	  don't fuck infront of the kids - even if it's vanilla sex.
	  
	  also pride isn't for the comfort of other people.

	- üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è also 
	  
	  I tend to quote tweet my own threads into threads as replies to threads.
	  
	  part of the goal is to get people lost in them if they bother to click through.
	  
	  the confusion is intentional. https://t.co/w0r1nkQTnK
	- why do I want homophobic anti-gay assholes to like me?
	  
	  no matter how much I assimilate into "I'm just like a straight guy that happens to like men, but the same as you in every way"
	  
	  they still going to hate us.
	  
	  pride isn't for them
	  fuck them. https://t.co/O3B45Q1DXn https://t.co/x2XNhck3eD
	- and family friendly is massive Anti-LGBTQ dog whistle. https://t.co/kSGuZLC377

	- üè≥‚Äç‚öß in other news - TERF groups like WoLF working with republicans to try and erase trans people. https://t.co/bge1UpVPcy
	- WoLF is also the one that put out media guidelines to say that queer is a slur. https://t.co/TR8czvNkuk
	- üë®‚Äçü¶≥ - Do you happen to have a thread with more information on how TERFs are trying to say queer is a slur?
	  
	  üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - obviously

	- even non-sexual relationships get labelled as kink https://t.co/KGmdeoTLF6
	- relationships that fall outside of traditional monogamy for the purpose of baby making are kink https://t.co/RsSgcHkbvn
	- and a historical thread on the connection between queer history, culture and kink by someone not me. https://t.co/g6T4Kpe8N0

	- but this one is worth repeating https://t.co/ZCGLW7LUWc
	- https://t.co/Z2VshO6gKr https://t.co/vo8DfvPaIr
	- that's more telling of you to instantly make the jump 
	  
	  kink = scat in the kindergarten room.
	  
	  I pointed out that family friendly pride events already do exist.
	  
	  and suggested you read some of this thread.
	  
	  you escalated to scat play, 
	  not me
	  
	  weirdo.

	- Good Morning queers!
	  
	  https://t.co/EHVzvtYaK9
	- üë®‚Äçüíº- I am going to define kink as anything that I don't want to see, then enter your spaces and demand that you remove yourself. I don't consent to you existing. https://t.co/5qgcPvo3ot
	- if you wore it, and it would be degrading to you 
	  
	  does not mean that  it's designed to be degrading, or that the people wearing it are being degraded.
	  
	  This says more about you, your beliefs - and trying to force those onto others.
	  
	  what are you, a cop?

	- üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - Did you know, one of my goals with this thread is to make it so long that twitter starts to act funny.

	- part way through this thread it splits into two and gets hard to find some things.
	  
	  breaking twitter is my kink https://t.co/EJpFK82PLA
	- üë®‚Äçüíº - Can you please present your puppy wear in a way that doesn't make the cis hets uncomfortable? we must tailor our expression for thier approval.
	  
	  üë®‚Äçüíº - See - look at these good puppies, it's like Jack from will and grace!

	- üë®‚Äçüíº - please sir,  can you assimilate into a proper respectable gay - it's your fault people hate the gays.
	  
	  üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - You do realize no matter how much we conform, they will still hate us?
	  
	  Like yeah - don't actually fuck infront of the kids, that's weird.
	  
	  but clothing is not sex. https://t.co/hQttmNTDnU https://t.co/iKXamSrbav
	- keep cis het kink out of Pride 
	  
	  https://t.co/o5TkDCpD38
	- üë®‚Äçüíº - keep pride family friendly 
	  üë®‚Äçüíº - also, drag Queen's are not family friendly 
	  üë®‚Äçüíº - also, anything that makes me slightly confused or uncomfortable, or if I could see how a made up person might find it uncomfortable, it's not family friendly 
	  
	  https://t.co/lNPRMGOsPV https://t.co/7A8XOrXKxy
	- Remember when Pride was actually a niche event only held on Halloween?
	  
	  apparently drag queen story time is the most immoral thing ever, became having people in costumes read to children is going to lead to the end of days 
	  https://t.co/mVik8ubVRC https://t.co/icI10CvnTe
	- "Conservatives must fight this leftist
	  insanity"
	  
	  "If we don't bring attention to what's
	  going on, activities such as "Drag Your Kids to Pride" will become normalized.
	  
	  "We cannot let that happen."
	  https://t.co/22DXSUAzAS
	- "I will be out protesting this event with my organization, Protect Texas Kids, and I encourage conservatives across the country to do the same."
	  
	  American friends - stay safe. https://t.co/PuIQOSj4VW
	- I'm such a respectable gay, so over pride.
	  
	  those queers are to blame for whatever hate they get, if they could just look like basic cis white bro like me they would be fine.
	  
	  https://t.co/iRtHGmOD0h https://t.co/onpzmVaxKg
	- üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - Having numerous family friendly, all ages event during Pride isn't enough. We need to keep those disrespectful gays out of all of the pride events, and push them back into the margins.
	  
	  They might be unsightly for people with delicate sensitivities.
	  
	  https://t.co/XlJZforafv https://t.co/I9hEUJC3dV
	- Apparently I'm being foolish and acting out of spite.
	  
	  I'd say I've been rather calm, civil, engaged with your bad faith arguments rather politely, and provided extra information beyond just my own opinions.
	  
	  are you just not used to people disagreeing with you? https://t.co/Lzmeqcqarj https://t.co/mt7PQGdODe
	- It took you long enough before you got featured in this mega thread.
	  
	  Maybe you should read some of it. https://t.co/nXrWVRP3lZ
	- there is quite a bit of information in here. https://t.co/zbXnT37nla
	- So informative, that adding our other exchange on how collapsing "accessibility" into "family friendly"
	  
	  is a good example of how that is actually actually pretty Abelist and problematic.
	  
	  spot the patterns of the no kink at pride crowd. https://t.co/iFhcxLEyjc
	- queer noises break 
	  https://t.co/saAHsCFXVb https://t.co/agbgVGSf7g
	- no lies detected 
	  https://t.co/iPsmq9EHYt
	- I'm only asking questions, and then providing well reasoned counter points to most of your arguments.
	  
	  I'm being pretty polite about it also.
	  
	  Hell, even free history lessons https://t.co/UaQeYfw4UX https://t.co/IklTYqu42E
	- Like how laws around clothing have historically been used to criminalize gay men https://t.co/7NCrRyuVUk
	- How the "keep it out of view/keep it to the clubs", has historically also put people at risk 
	  
	  and those venues tend to have barriers of entry a cover, acrddsibility issues, etc - like improving the accessibility of those is important. https://t.co/0WvkZXQMOd
	- and touching on ways to address accessibility - although not an exhaustive one, at pride. https://t.co/6trhUKsgVm
	- like - are you a cop or something? https://t.co/62CB7adk6K
	- like - no matter how much it gets toned down for Becky, Chad and little Apple, policing how people dress won't make it safer.
	  
	  predators will adopt whatever dress code is required of them. https://t.co/mrpRbivPCY https://t.co/62O1qt2FJi
	- oh you've finally started to realize I'm talking at you and not to you.
	  
	  well done.
	  
	  I'm not farming disagreement for likes.
	  
	  I'm highlighting common patterns in the no kink at pride arguments and how they are almost all BS 
	  
	  and you my friend have been a shining example. https://t.co/TjXuENIfKp https://t.co/qvYMSyehtQ
	- üë®‚Äçüíº - maybe if you dress respectfully, they won't hate you 
	  üë®‚Äçüé§ - you realize that they view a man wearing a dress as a mental illness? no amount of respectability will make them like us 
	  
	  https://t.co/HEXHHtUfrm
	- üë®‚Äçüíº - maybe just tone it down for one year? lay low you know?
	  üë®‚Äçüé§ - so they can continue to call people degenerates, and then point at the good respectable gays and say - why can't everyone he like them?

	- queer meme break https://t.co/GGxqyavHiA
	- welcome back from the break,
	  
	  I've found some excellent reading for you, that goes over the connection between kink, pride - the difference between clothing, and sex 
	  
	  and why kink belongs at pride.
	  
	  Great üßµ
	  https://t.co/qs4iDX23Rt https://t.co/uXx34OMJ6D
	- The gay scene / culture is different across cities, let alone countries and continents.
	  
	  Why do people seem to think that pride is exactly the same in every city? https://t.co/qnkbL5LOFd https://t.co/jNIlfxyIOM
	- reminder 
	  
	  this is an information dump
	  not a discussion https://t.co/jXyNTzGFcN
	- people who take a distorted view of consent and then weaponize it to control others for $500
	  
	  https://t.co/9byU2afT09 https://t.co/nP1f2t3Ysz
	- isn't consent like super important?"
	  
	  it is actually - and understanding the difference between
	- üë©üèª‚Äçü¶≥ - How do you weaponize consent?
	  
	  üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - let this person explain https://t.co/Y1K7cLrXFv
	- on Consent, because people keep throwing this word around like they just learned it and it's their new favourite thing.
	  
	  TL;DR - I don't need your consent for what I put on my body. https://t.co/oYXkUQh63E
	- kink isn't inherently a sex act 
	  clothing is not sex 
	  
	  people wearing leather, harnesses, masks is not them having sex.
	- Apparently I lack empathy, oh well. https://t.co/68YI4dVyVP
