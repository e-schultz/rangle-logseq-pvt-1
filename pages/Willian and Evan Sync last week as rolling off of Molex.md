- Ok, so willian had asked me a bit about this on slack, and it's something I've been wanting to do anyways - and since most of the last month none of my nights have been in obsidian, it's going to be a lot of memory + slack history + notion notes getting pulled into here.
  collapsed:: true

	  No problem;
		- (a) How are you?
		  (b) Any blockers or frustrations?
		  (c) Molex: It would be good to have a tech program review to share in the techregroup session

		- c) I would like the Devs to practice presentation & assembling a deck - Anderson’s one can be used as a template guide… it’s simple, should be lightweight and value-oriented… venting off should be avoided, sharing frustrations is ok, and showing what non-technical challenges we had is more than welcomed.
